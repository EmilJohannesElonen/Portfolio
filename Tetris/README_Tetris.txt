This is my own take at the classic Tetris game featuring a GUI created with QTCreator and C++. It was my very first proper GUI application using C++, with previous experience
coming mainly from Python. It was the final project for a programming course included in my studies.  
More information about playing the game can be found in the instructions.txt file (currently only available in finnish).
